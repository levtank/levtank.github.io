	In 2017, I collaborated with another researcher, an animation studio, and a sound designer from Italy to creat a short, animated film about the neuroscience of touch perception. My role included co-creating the film concept, co-writing the script, co-consulting on the science, and narration. The film won the best National/International Film at the <i>Bristol Science Film Festival (2017)</i>, and was officially selected for the <i>Goethe Institut Science Film Festival</i>, and the <i>Super Geek Film Festival</i>. Watch the film below and see the dedicated <a href="https://justatouchfilm.com/" target="_blank">film website</a> for more details.
